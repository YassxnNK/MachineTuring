# Prototype V-Alpha

## Base code
  - Implementation of the struct and enums
  - Implementation of the base functions to translate in MPlab (the only functions to change is light leds)
  - Add comments so we're not lost

## Chores:
  - Add a changelog to keep track of the evolution

## TODO: 
  - Implementation of the json parser into the the simulation code
  - Write the README
  - Discuss and resolve the TODO commented text in the base implementation
  - Rewrite all the diagram because I keep changing the main structure again and again
